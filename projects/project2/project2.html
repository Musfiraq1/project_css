  <p class="heading3">The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS">birad</a>,or berger de brie, is a large breed
    of dog traditionally used as a
    herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
  <h3 class="heading4">Breed History</h3>
  <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
    centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
    sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense
    of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of
    extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering.
    Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
